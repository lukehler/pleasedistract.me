We all need a little distraction from time to time. To help aid in that, we've got a curated list of links that we think you might like. You're given a single link at random. Using the "refresh" button or reloading the page will get you a different random link each time.

While there is no lack of interesting, heartwarming, or even funny material on the current pandemic, you won't find it here. This is intended as a brief escape.

Take a deep breath, read something you may not have expected, and enjoy.
